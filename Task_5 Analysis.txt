As a sports analyst from the first workbook related to the Bowler, I can see that SL Malinga seems to be the 
most effective bowler with a very low economy, huge experience factor and a lot of wickets in his bag.
From the second workbook, we can see that Chris Gayle is the most effective batsman of all with a great 
average, a lot of experience and also most number of Player of The Match award in his bag. 
Since Chris Gayle is also a good bowler and his batting is definitely off the charts we can conclude that 
if a company endorses Chris Gayle, it would be good for the company as the return on investment is pretty high
for this player.
Now, if we see the most successful teams then the two names, Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians definitely
clash with Mumbai Indians winning most of the tosses and games. If we look at the geographical map then we can
also conclude that most of the teams win in there home games. We can also see that Mumbai Indians not only wins
a lot of matches but is also dominant in their wins by winning by a huge amount of runs or by huge amount of
wickets in their hand.
